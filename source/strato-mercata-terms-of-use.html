<h2>Our Services</h2>

<p>STRATO Products and services refers to the services and products that are ordered by you pursuant to an Order Form and made available online via the STRATO Site or affiliated website or application by STRATO, including associated STRATO offline or mobile components. STRATO Products may include, but are not limited to, STRATO, Art, Carbon, and other STRATO-branded platforms owned and/or operated by STRATO that allow users to process and record transactions on the STRATO blockchain provided by STRATO.</p>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, STRATO will (i) make the Services available to you pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Order Forms for the STRATO Product, (ii) provide applicable STRATO standard support for the specific STRATO Product to you pursuant to the Term of Use for the relevant STRATO Product, and (iii) undertake commercially reasonable efforts to make the STRATO Products available to you except for: (x) scheduled or emergency maintenance, or (y) in the event you are in breach of the Agreement or any specific STRATO Product order form, including failure to pay any amounts due to STRATO, or (z) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond STRATO's reasonable control, including, for example, an act of God, act of government, flood, fire, earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem, Internet link failure or delay, a Non-STRATO application, or denial of service attack.</p>

<p>In order to process transactions via STRATO or on any other STRATO Product, you may be required to enter into a "Smart Contract", which contract is created to record the initial transfer of real-world assets on the Platform and any subsequent transfers thereto. A "Smart Contract" means a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code wherein the code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized STRATO blockchain network and the execution and transactions of which are trackable and irreversible. The Terms of Use for the relevant STRATO Product will specify when Smart Contracts will be required and related terms and conditions for their use.</p>

<h2>Beta Services</h2>

<p>From time to time, STRATO may make Beta services available to you. You may choose to try such Beta services or not in your sole discretion. Any use of Beta Services is subject to any additional Beta services terms provided by STRATO at the time the Beta Services are made available.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>STRATO makes money when you add a transaction to the STRATO blockchain.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that your acceptance of this Agreement is considered your acceptance of our transaction fees as follows:</p>

<p>Every transaction on a STRATO Product is subject to fees collected to support the STRATO Product. The Terms of Use for the specific STRATO Product will specify whether you are going to be charged a transaction fee. You hereby authorize the STRATO to initiate debits in your account in settlement of the transactions being made on the relevant STRATO Product, agree to pay STRATO any transaction fees being charged for the sale or purchase of the asset(s), and authorize STRATO to deduct such fees from your account directly. You agree and understand that all fees, commissions, and royalties are transferred, processed, or initiated directly through one or more of the Smart Contracts on the STRATO blockchain network. Transaction fee charges may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).</p>

<p>By transacting on the STRATO blockchain network in respect of a particular STRATO Product and by using the corresponding Smart Contracts for that transaction, you hereby acknowledge, consent to, and accept all automated fees, commissions, and royalties for the transaction relating to the purchase and sale of any asset via a STRATO Product. You further consent to and agree to be bound by the Smart Contracts' execution and distribution of the fees, commissions, and royalties. When executing a Smart Contract in the capacity of a "Purchaser", you hereby waive any entitlement to fees, commissions, or royalties paid to another by operation of the Smart Contracts. When executing a Smart Contract in the capacity of a "Seller" in a Smart Contract, you hereby waive any entitlement to fees, commissions, or royalties paid to another by operation of the Smart Contracts.</p>

<p>You further authorize us to store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., bank account) to avoid interruptions in your transactions and to facilitate easy payment for new transactions.</p>

<p>The Parties agree and understand that as the STRATO Marketplace is in Beta testing as of the date of this Agreement, all payments, fees, commissions, and royalties will be transferred, processed, or initiated through ACH/Wire transfer, Stripe, Paypal, or other similar means and thereafter recorded on the Smart Contract until the STRATO Marketplace activates capacity to collect payment information securely on-chain.</p>

<p>You cannot reverse, cancel, or change a transaction that has been marked as pending or complete. If your payment method has insufficient funds or if you reverse payment made by you to us, you authorize STRATO, at its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other linked payment methods in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel, correct, or reverse your transaction in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if we suspect that the transaction may involve money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime. STRATO is under no obligation to reinstate a transaction on the same terms as the cancelled, corrected, or reversed transaction.</p>

<h2>Third Party Services and Content</h2>

<p>We utilize links and other tools to connect users to third-party services and websites, including, but not limited to, AWS Cloud Platform to host STRATO and third-party payment processors to process USD payment between you and STRATO ("Third Party Services"). We have no control over these Third-Party Services, and in no event shall we be held responsible or liable for the accuracy, reliability, or contemporaneity of any third-party's services, content, or policies. Users who access or use a Third-Party Service through STRATO are solely responsible for complying with the terms and policies of these third parties.</p>

<p>In no event shall a description or reference to a third-party's product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement of such third-party product or service by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third-Party Service.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>The STRATO Products contain our proprietary property including, but not limited to our platform and are protected by copyright law, registered and unregistered trademarks, database rights, and other intellectual property rights. Unless otherwise provided, we exclusively own rights to the STRATO Products and your use of the STRATO Products does not grant you any right, title, or interest in the STRATO Products.</p>

<h2>Your Use of Our Services</h2>

<p>If you sign-up for an account, we ask that you abide by a few commonsense rules. You agree that you will not violate any laws when using our Services. You also agree to not take any action that may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our or any of our third-party providers' infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, SERVANTS, COUNSEL, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, LAWYERS, AND OTHER PERSONNEL AUTHORIZED TO ACT, ACTING, OR PURPORTING TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY to use the STRATO Products.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>

<p>This Agreement and your use of the STRATO Products are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands without regard to conflict of law principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.</p>
